    <p class="information">Athena is the daughter of Zeus, but she had an unusual birth. Zeus conceived Athena with his first wife, Metis, but he tricked Metis and ate her before he knew she was pregnant. One day Zeus had a headache and asked to have his head opened, which caused Athena to pop out of his head fully grown.</p>
